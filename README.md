ping-and-tell
=============

Ping an address and announce when it works.  Currently works only on OSX(pull requests please)

# Usage

	bash pingandtell.sh <ip address> <success cheer>

# Why

Told a guy at work that I had a ping running and I would know when that firewall was back up.  He said it would be a bit hard to know since I was at his desk.
